# CardDeck
Simple card deck visualized, built in Unity

Was built as a programming assignment. I was tasked with building a system where it would be possible to add different cards
(each with their own unique parameters) to a deck, which in turn would be shown off visually. The user would also be able to
either sort cards based on their type or to order them bases on their stats

For animating purposes I used Demigiants DOTween asset package
This repo features only the code, since the graphical assets provided to me are copyrighted to Ubisoft Redlynx
